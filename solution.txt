1. Development Environment Setup
Prior to watching any of the livestreams, you’ll want to go through the setup steps listed in 
GitHub readme
. This will help you get started with an Atlas free tier account (if you don’t already have one) and download Compass.

2. Pre-launch: Rocket launch setup and basic analytical queries with MongoDB’s aggregation framework
The 
Livestream 1
 recording will walk you through the data captured in a rocket launch and how to write basic aggregation queries with MongoDB’s query API. Then you’ll perform basic analytics on the IoT sensor data with Atlas Charts.

3. During-launch: Embedding visualizations and building search capabilities in a React app for real-time analytics
Livestream 2
 will show you how to embed charts into a React app for real-time analytics, and how to create a search capability for finding insights for specific notes, automated or manually generated, of interest.

4. Post-launch: Finding insights across multiple application and third-party data sources
Lastly, 
Livestream 3
 will show you how to find post-operation insights by combining rocket launch data with weather data from the same time frame and analyzing it in Tableau.
